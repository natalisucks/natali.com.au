Hello, my name is <em>Natali Vlatko</em> and I'm in <em>ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT</em>.

I shitpost on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/natalisucks). I used to work in <em>TECH COMMS</em>, writing  about technology [here](https://jaxenter.com/author/natalivlatko), [here](https://tech.zalando.com/blog/), and [here](https://tech.wayfair.com).

Open source software and highlighting women in technical roles are my thing.

Do you want to send me an E-Mail? [natalivlatko@gmail.com](mailto:natalivlatko@gmail.com)
