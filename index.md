I have just moved to Berlin from Singapore and have volunteer experience at local museums in my native Sydney, Australia.

I have a Bachelors degree in History and Philosophy as well as a Masters in Ancient History. My work experience over the last ten years has seen me excel in an administrative capacity for a variety of companies.

I currently occupy the volunteer position of News Editor for PASSAGE Magazine, a publication of the Friends of the Museums in Singapore.

I'd love for you to hire me! Send me an E-Mail: [natalivlatko@gmail.com](mailto:natalivlatko@gmail.com)
